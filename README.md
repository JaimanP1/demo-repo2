# Demo 2

uploading a remote repository from local machine

## notes

same process of adding and commiting a file 

except instead of pushing straightaway (no remote repository exists to be pushed to), have to create one

once that is done on the website, use https address on remote add origin action

then can do the push origin main command

main worked instead of master???
