# Demo 2

## notes

uploading a repository from local machine to github

same process of adding and commiting a file 

except instead of pushing straightaway (no remote repository exists to be pushed to), have to create one

once that is done on the website, use https address on remote add origin action

then can do the push origin main command

main worked instead of master???

## more notes

for branching, use git checkout commands

to check which branch, use branch command

on new branch, use add and commit commands as normal

check differences between main and branch using diff command

push changes to github

create pull request

go to github and approve merge there OR

merge from local machine

then on master/main branch, pull new code

finally delete branch

## special cases notes

if code is in conflict, then have three options

approve from incoming changes (from brach)

approve only changes made on main/master

edit in vscode directly

## undoing notes

if have used the add command but want to go back, use reset

if commited, use reset HEAD~1

log command to see all commits

can use git reset and hash of commit you want to go back to

can also use git reset hard

## forking

way to create personal copy of entire repository owned by another user

## vs code

can also do a lot of these actions directly from vs code

use gitbash for terminal settings

use source control on side panel to commit
