# Demo 2

uploading a remote repository from local machine

## notes

same process of adding and commiting a file 

except instead of pushing straightaway (no remote repository exists to be pushed to), have to create one

once that is done on the website, use https address on remote add origin action

then can do the push origin main command

main worked instead of master???

## more notes

for branching, use git checkout commands

to check which branch, use branch command

on new branch, use add and commit commands as normal

check differences between main and branch using diff command

create pull request

go to github and approve merge there OR

merge from local machine
